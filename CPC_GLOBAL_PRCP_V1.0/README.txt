CPC Global Daily Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Precipitation - GlobalPPT_CPC

******************************************************************************

This data set is part of products suite from the CPC Unified Precipitation Project that are underway at NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The primary goal of the project is to create a suite of unified precipitation products with consistent quantity and improved quality by combining all information sources available at CPC and by taking advantage of the optimal interpolation (OI) objective analysis technique. Values are acculated for a day but that day can be at different times for different locations. See the documentation.

Global spatial coverage (0.5 X 0.5 around 50Km X 50km)

None Restrictions, but it is requested to acknowledgeus in the use of the data.
This may be done by including text such as "CPC Global Unified Precipitation data provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/" in any documents or publications using these data. 
CPC would also appreciate receiving a copy of the relevant publications as this will help PSD to justify keeping the CPC Global Unified Precipitation data set freely available online in the future.
