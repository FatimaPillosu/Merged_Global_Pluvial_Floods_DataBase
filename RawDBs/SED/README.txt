*** ACCESS RIGHTS TO THE RAW DATA CONTAINED IN THIS REPOSITORY ***
The original owners of the raw reports contained in the directory "RawDBs" in the GitHub repository "https://github.com/FatimaPillosu/Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB" have kindly granted a special access to such data for the ONLY purpose of a fully replicability and reproducibility of the research developed using the Jupyter Notebook "Merged_Global_FlashFlood_DB.ipynb" contained in the above mentioned GitHub repository. Such data accessibility has been granted according the following principles:
    - Draw more reliable conclusions. Researchers can validate the results obtained with the above mentioned Jupyter Notebook by analysing the adopted methods in the study on the basis of the same data. After that, new research questions can be inspired by different research approaches and through the study of new methodologies, which can help to reduce bias in the analytics, experimental design, and conclusion drawing.
    - Minimize data redundancy of research efforts. By making data available to the users of the above mentioned Jupyter Notebook, researchers can reduce the number of redundant experiments conducted and, instead, iterate upon exiting research to accelerate discovery. 
Any other use (commercial or not) of the raw data contained in this repository is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. 
By accessing or using the raw data in the directory "RawDBs" in the above mentioned GitHub repository, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not wish to be bound by these terms and conditions, you may not access or use in any form the raw data in the directory "RawDBs" in the above mentioned GitHub repository.
