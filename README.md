# Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB
This Jupyter notebook runs the Matlab Toolbox "MGFFD" created to merge flash flood reports from different sources, and create a merged global flash flood database. 

There are two ways to run this Jupyter notebook:
1. On a web brower, click on the toggle "launch binder".
2. On your own machine, run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/FatimaPillosu/Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB.git
$ cd Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB
$ ./Launch_Jupyter_Matlab.sh $MatlabRoot # It can be determined by running the command 'matlabroot' in the Matlab command line
```
