# Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB
This Jupyter notebook runs the Matlab Toolbox "MGFFD" created to merge flash flood reports from different sources, and create a merged global flash flood database. 

There are two ways to run this Jupyter notebook:
1. Run it on a web brower using MyBynder.org by clicking on the toggle "launch binder".
2. Run it on your machine by running the following commands:
```sh
$ cd $WorkDir # Working directory where the repository will be cloned
$ git clone https://github.com/FatimaPillosu/Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB.git
$ cd Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB
$ ./Launch_Jupyter_Matlab.sh $MatlabRoot #it can be determined by running the command 'matlabroot' in the Matlab command line
```
