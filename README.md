------------------------------------------

This repository contains:
1. the Matlab toolbox "MGFFDB" that collects, from different sources, (flash) flood reports due to heavy rainfall, and merge them into one single global flash flood database.
2. a Jupyter notebook that runs the Matlab toolbox "MGFFDB".  

The merging operation undertaken in the toolbox is more than a mere blending exercise. It uses data wrangling to ehnhance the usability of the raw datasets in understanding the capability of current global rainfall forecasts in predicting (flash) flood prone areas. 
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or in the cloud for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

There are two ways to run the Jupyter notebook:
1. In the cloud, on a web brower: click on the badge "launch binder".
2. On your local machine: 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/FatimaPillosu/Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB.git
$ cd Merged-Global-Flash-Flood-DB
$ ./Launch_Jupyter_Matlab.sh
```
